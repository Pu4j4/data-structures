What is Linked List?

    A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers as shown in the below image:

In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

It is basically chains of nodes, each node contains information such as data and a pointer to the next node in the chain. In the linked list there is a head pointer, which points to the first element of the linked list, and if the list is empty then it simply points to null or nothing.

Why linked list data structure needed?

Here are a few advantages of a linked list that is listed below, it will help you understand why it is necessary to know.

    Dynamic Data structure: The size of memory can be allocated or de-allocated at run time based on the operation insertion or deletion.

    Ease of Insertion/Deletion: The insertion and deletion of elements are simpler than arrays since no elements need to be shifted after insertion and deletion, Just the address needed to be updated.

    Efficient Memory Utilization: As we know Linked List is a dynamic data structure the size increases or decreases as per the requirement so this avoids the wastage of memory. 

    Implementation: Various advanced data structures can be implemented using a linked list like a stack, queue, graph, hash maps, etc.

Types of linked lists: 

There are mainly three types of linked lists:
   1.Single-linked list
   2.Double linked list
   3.Circular linked list
