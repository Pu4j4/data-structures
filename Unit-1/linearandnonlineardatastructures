Linear Data Structure:

    Those data structures where the data elements are organised in some sequence is called linear data structure.

    Here the various operations on a data structure are possible only in a sequence i.e. we cannot insert the element into any location of our choice. E.g. A new element in a queue can come only at the end, not anywhere else.

    Examples of linear data structures are array, stacks, queue, and linked list.
    They can be implemented in memory using two ways.

    The first method is by having a linear relationship between elements by means of sequential memory locations.

    The second method is by having a linear relationship by using links.

    Non-Linear Data Structure:

    When the data elements are organised in some arbitrary function without any sequence, such data structures are called non-linear data structures.
    
    Examples of such type are trees, graphs.

    The relationship of adjacency is not maintained between elements of a non-linear data structure.
